# CSS Flex Box
The CSS provided applies Flexbox to create a responsive layout for profile cards. The .profile-container uses display: flex with flex-wrap: wrap, allowing cards to wrap and maintain alignment. justify-content: center ensures the cards are centered horizontally, while gap: 20px manages the spacing between them. Each .profile-card has consistent padding and uses hover effects to improve user interaction. Flexbox simplifies the alignment and distribution of elements, making the layout adaptive across different screen sizes.
